1- XMLBasedConfiguration
2- AnnotationBasedConfiguration
3- Bean Scope- Singleton & Prototype
4- Bean Life Cycle: It contain 7 different steps
    1- Definition the bean i.e. we will define that these the bean that we will create.
    2- Bean creation or instantiation process: After Define, Spring will instantiate those beans.
    3- Assigning: Populating the properties related to bean like , id, scope or default values provided to properties
    5- Post Initialization Step: In this step what ever the interface we have created will be executed
       i.e. custom execution will be performed in this step.
       So now Bean is ready to server and bean will be available in the container
    6- Pre- Destruction of Bean:When the bean is destroying then Here we can write some custom logic for cleanup
    7- Destruction of Bean: Here the bean will be destroyed from the JVM itself.
So the above is all about the Spring basics and dependency injection

5- AOP- Aspect-Oriented-Programming:
6- Created Spring Boot project by added spring boot starter dependeices
